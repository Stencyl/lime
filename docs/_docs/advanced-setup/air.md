## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for AIR.

## Manual Install

In order to build applications using AIR, you must have the Adobe AIR SDK installed.

[Download](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html) the Adobe AIR SDK, and extract it on your system.

Next, open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command (using the path to your AIR SDK):

    lime config AIR_SDK path/to/air/sdk
