## Listing Samples

Lime includes a number of samples, which you can duplicate to build or to use as a starting point. To list all of the available samples:

    lime create

## Creating Samples

If you find a sample you would like to create, you can create it using the "create" command:

    lime create HelloWorld

This will create a copy of the sample within the current directory, using the same name as the sample. If you prefer, you can also specify a custom target directory:

    lime create SimpleImage ImageTest
